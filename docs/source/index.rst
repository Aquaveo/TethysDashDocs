Welcome to TethysDash documentation!
===================================

**TethysDash** is a `tethys <https://www.tethysplatform.org/>`_ application in which users can create customized 
dashboards for simplified data discovery.

Visualizations for the dashboards are based on preinstalled visualization plugins. For more information 
on the plugin architecture and developing new visualization plugins, see the :doc:`plugins` section. 

Once visualization plugins are installed, users can created their own unique dashboards in any configuration and 
setup for whatever desired purpose. Below are some example dashboards and use cases.
