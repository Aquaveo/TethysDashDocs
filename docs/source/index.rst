Welcome to TethysDash documentation!
===================================

**TethysDash** is a `tethys <https://www.tethysplatform.org/>`_ application in which users can create customized 
dashboards for simplified data discovery.

To use a demo version of TethysDash, visit `http://demo.firo.aquaveo.com/apps/tethysdash/ <http://demo.firo.aquaveo.com/apps/tethysdash/>`_

Visualizations for the dashboards are based on preinstalled visualization plugins. For more information 
on the plugin architecture and developing new visualization plugins, see the :doc:`plugins` section. 

Once visualization plugins are installed, users can created their own unique dashboards in any configuration and 
setup for whatever desired purpose. Below are some example dashboards and use cases.
