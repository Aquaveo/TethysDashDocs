Visualization Requests
----------------------

All visualizations available in dashboards are derived from a plugin infrastructure. For more information about 
plugins, refer to the see the :doc:`plugins` section. This infrastructure allows users and developers to easily create 
customized visualizations for whatever purpose they may need. If there are any visualizations that users would like 
in their dashboards, they can try to make their own or create a request of Aquaveo to develop them. 

If you would like to request a new visualization, the best way would be to create a github request. This allows for 
better tracking and correspondence. If you do not have a github account, reach out to ckrewson@aquaoveo.com for help in 
requesting a new visualization and provide the same information as step numbers 3 and 4 below. 

If you have a github account and would like to request a new visualization, please do the following:

    1. Go to https://github.com/Aquaveo/TethysDashDocs/issues/new to open up a new issue/request.
    2. Click on "Labels" on the right side of the screen and select "enhancement"
    3. Provide a clear and concise title for the desired visualization.
    4. Provide a clear description of the following:
        
        - What is the visualization?
        - What type of visualization is it? Is it an image, chart, table, map, etc?
        - If the visualization is already available somewhere else, what is the url to view it?
        - If the visualization needs to be created, like a new chart for example, what does it need to look like?


Bugs/Issues
-----------
If you experience a bug or issue, the best way to let Aquaveo know would be to create a github issue. This allows for 
better tracking and correspondence. If you do not have a github account, reach out to ckrewson@aquaoveo.com for help 
and provide the same information as step numbers 3 and 4 below. 

If you have a github account and submit an issue, please do the following:

    1. Go to https://github.com/Aquaveo/TethysDashDocs/issues/new to open up a new issue/request.
    2. Click on "Labels" on the right side of the screen and select "bug"
    3. Provide a clear and concise title for the desired visualization.
    4. Provide a clear description of the following:
        
        - What is the issue?
        - Is the issue reproducible?
        - What are the steps taken to encounter the issue/bug?
