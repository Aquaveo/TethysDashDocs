Users are only able to edit dashboards that they have created. Once a user created dashboard is selected, 
click on the |dashboard_edit_button| button next to the dashboard dropdown at the top of the app to turn 
on edit mode. Once in edit mode, additional buttons for reverting changes, saving changes, and adding new 
dashboard items will appear.
