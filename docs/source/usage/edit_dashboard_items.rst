Users are only able to edit dashboards that they have created. Once a user created dashboard is selected, 
click on the |dashboard_edit_button| button in the right side of the app header to turn 
on edit mode. Once in edit mode, additional buttons for reverting changes, saving changes, and adding new 
dashboard items will appear.
