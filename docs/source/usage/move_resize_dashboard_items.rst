Moving/Resizing Items
---------------------

Once in edit mode, each dashboard item can be moved by clicking and holding inside the item and then dragging 
the mouse to the desired location. The salmon colored background will indicate when the item will settle once the user 
stops holding down the click. Each dashboard item can be resized by dragging on the resize handler in the bottom right corner 
of the item.
