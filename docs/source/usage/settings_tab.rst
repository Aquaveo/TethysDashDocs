Settings Tab
------------

Visualization can each have individual settings that apply to that visualization only. Some settings are available for 
all visualizations, while others may only be application to certain types of visualizations. Below is a list of 
possible visualization settings.

`````````````````````````````````
Refresh Rate (All Visualizations)
`````````````````````````````````

The refresh rate indicates how often a visualization should update automatically on the dashboard. This setting is 
used for when visualizations may update due to new data being available. Instead of having to refresh the entire 
dashboard to check for new data, this setting will do it automatically at the desired refresh rate for the specified 
dashboard item. A refresh rate of 0 indicates that it will not refresh.

```````````````````````````
Border (All Visualizations)
```````````````````````````

The border will provide a border around the dashboard item. Borders can be controlled for all sides at once or individual 
borders can have their own styling. Click on the border you want to style and chose the color, style and width.

`````````````````````````````````````
Background Color (All Visualizations)
`````````````````````````````````````

The background color will provide a color inside the dashboard item. Click on the box to select the color and opacity.

```````````````````````````````````````````
Use Box Shadow Styling (All Visualizations)
```````````````````````````````````````````

Check this option to provide a box shadow around the dashboard item. This will cause a box shadow following the colors 
selected for the border.

```````````````````````````````````````````
Custom Messaging (All Visualizations)
```````````````````````````````````````````

These are custom messages that will be shown when there are issues with the dashboard item. The "Error" custom message 
option will always be available and will be shown in the visualization when there is an error retrieving the visualization 
data.

If the visualization depends on a variable input, then additional options will be shwon for each variable input. These 
custom messages will be shown when the variable input value is empty.

````````````````````````````````````````````
Enforce Aspect Ratio  (Image Visualizations)
````````````````````````````````````````````

The enforce aspect ratio option will cause any resizing of the visualization to keep the original aspect ratio from 
the image source.
