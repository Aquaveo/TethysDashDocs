Settings Tab
-----------------

.. _settings_tab:

Visualization can each have individual settings that apply to that visualization only. Some settings are available for 
all visualizations, while others may only be application to certain types of visualizations. Below is a list of 
possible visualization settings.

`````````````````````````````````
Refresh Rate (All Visualizations)
`````````````````````````````````

The refresh rate indicates how often a visualization should update automatically on the dashboard. This setting is 
used for when visualizations may update due to new data being available. Instead of having to refresh the entire 
dashboard to check for new data, this setting will do it automatically at the desired refresh rate for the specified 
dashboard item. A refresh rate of 0 indicates that it will not refresh.

````````````````````````````````````````````
Enforce Aspect Ratio  (Image Visualizations)
````````````````````````````````````````````

The enforce aspect ratio option will cause any resizing of the visualization to keep the original aspect ratio from 
the image source.
