When a dashboard is selected in the dashboard dropdown, a settings (|dashboard_settings_button|) button will appear 
in the app header. Click on the settings button to open up the dashboard settings menu. If the 
selected dashboard was created by the user, then all settings can be changed and saved.

====
Name

Indicates the dashboard name. This is the text that will appear in the url for a public dashboard. Dashboard names can 
only be letters and numbers and cannot include any special characters.

Users cannot create multiple dashboards of their own with the same name. A dashboard with the same name as a public 
dashboard can be created but it cannot be made public with that same name.

===========
Description

landing page of the application. 

==============
Sharing Status
==============

Indicates if the dashboard will be private (only accessible to the user) or public (accessible to anyone). Public 
dashboards are accessible to anyone but can only be edited by the user who created it.

No public dashboards can have the same name.

================================
Unrestricted Grid Item Placement
================================

Indicates if the dashboard items can be placed anywhere in the dashboard, including overlapping.

Notes

Users can write, save, and edit notes for the dashboard. For public dashboards, these notes can be seen by anyone 
that accesses the dashboard.

Saving Dashboard Settings

To persist any setting changes, click on the "Save changes" button on the bottom of the dashboard settings panel.
