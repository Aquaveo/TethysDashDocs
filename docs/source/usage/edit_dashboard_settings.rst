When a dashboard is selected in the dashboard dropdown, a hamburger (|dashboard_settings_button|) button will appear 
on the left in the application header. Click on the hamburger button to open up the dashboard settings menu. If the 
selected dashboard was created by the user, then all settings can be changed and saved.

====
Name
====

Indicates the dashboard name. This is the text that will appear in the url for a public dashboard. Dashboard names can 
only be letters and numbers and cannot include any special characters.

Users cannot create multiple dashboards of their own with the same name. A dashboard with the same name as a public 
dashboard can be created but it cannot be made public with that same name.

=====
Label
=====

Indicates the dashboard label. This is the text that will appear in the dashboard dropdown and can include spaces and 
special characters.

Users cannot create multiple dashboards of their own with the same label. A dashboard with the same label as a public 
dashboard can be created but it cannot be made public with that same label.

==============
Sharing Status
==============

Indicates if the dashboard will be private (only accessible to the user) or public (accessible to anyone). Public 
dashboards are accessible to anyone but can only be edited by the user who created it.

No public dashboards can have the same name or the same label.

=====
Notes
=====

Users can write, save, and edit notes for the dashboard. For public dashboards, these notes can be seen by anyone 
that accesses the dashboard.

=========================
Saving Dashboard Settings
=========================

To persist any setting changes, click on the "Save changes" button on the bottom of the dashboard settings panel.
